# OrganizePhotos

Introduction

  Organize Photos is an iOS application that I have built as my personal/side project. The entire project is built programmatically using Swift programming language. I did not use story board at all and the reason is to improve its performance. Other frameworks such as Restnet50 and Core Data are also used for this project. Restnet50 is a machine learning framework that is used for performing object recognition on the photos. For Core Data framework, it is used to store data locally on the device.
  
Purpose and How it Works

  The purpose of this application is to help you organize all the photos on your phone by performing Object Recognition framework. It works by creating a list of category based on your photos. 
  
How to Use

  When you first open Organize Photos application, it will ask for your permission to access your Photo Library. Please allow this application to have access to your Photo Library in order for it to works on your mobile device. Once you allow access, click on the upper left button to get started. This could take some time depending on the amount of photos that you have in your Photo Library. Once it finishes, the app will show you a list of category. For example, if your Photo Library has dog and car pictures, the list of category will contain Dog and Car categories. Feel free to tap on any of the categories and this application will show you all the pictures that are related to the name of the category. For instance, when you tap on Dog category, it will show all the dog pictures that you have on your phone. The best part is that the next time you open this app, all the categories and photos are saved, which means that you do not have to click on the upper left button again. Only click on the upper left button if you have new photos and want to update the list of category. 
  
Features

  Organize Photos application also provides a search feature which allows user to search for a specific category conveniently.
